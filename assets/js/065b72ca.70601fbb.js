In order to be able to mint (create) and melt (destroy) ecash, you need to plug your mint into a Lightning backend. The best practice is to run your own dedicated Lightning node, such as LND or CLN. Running a Lightning node comes with its own responsibilities. You need to make sure that you properly back up your seed phrase, regularly export your static channel backups, and, ideally, have a copy of your node's database in case of a catastrophic incident. These are all things that apply to Lightning nodes, with or without ecash. You should be aware of these things whenever you run a Lightning node, so I will assume that your setup is safe and you have enough experience keeping your node happy and alive."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Nutshell also works with custodial backends.
