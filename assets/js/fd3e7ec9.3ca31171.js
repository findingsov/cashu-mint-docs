Accounts are terrible for privacy but they allow you to do one good thing which is to rate-limit the requests of your users. As we\'ve seen, a mint\'s database can only grow if we don\'t regularly rotate keys and crop the database. This poses an attack vector in which users can spend ecash to themselves forever and slowly force the mint\'s database to grow relatively quickly. This is not nice but it can happen. There are several mitigation strategies for this.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guides/migration":{"id":"Guides/migration","title":"Migrating Your Mint","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guides/monitoring":{"id":"Guides/monitoring","title":"Monitoring Your Mint","description":"Periodically Check Login Attempts Jail","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guides/protectingserver":{"id":"Guides/protectingserver","title":"Protecting Your Server","description":"Fail2ban","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guides/rotatingkeysets":{"id":"Guides/rotatingkeysets","title":"Plan to Rotate Keysets","description":"Every ecash transaction your users make will leave entries in your database so that your mint can remember which ecash has been spent before. That means that, in the most basic case, your database\'s size will grow indefinitely, which is obviously not a sustainable state of affairs. This growth is fairly small and I have seen a Nutshell database grow to a mere size of a few dozen MB over a course of more than a year of usage.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guides/shuttingdownmint":{"id":"Guides/shuttingdownmint","title":"Shutting Down a Mint","description":"Cashu provides several","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guides/upgrading":{"id":"Guides/upgrading","title":"Upgrading Your Mint","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/checklist":{"id":"Introduction/checklist","title":"Checklist","description":"Use this checklist to ensure you have not missed any of the best practices noted in this guide.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/getting_started":{"id":"Introduction/getting_started","title":"Getting Started","description":"This guide is currently a generic best practice document that applies across most of the existing mint implementations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/ongoingcare":{"id":"Introduction/ongoingcare","title":"Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance","description":"Understand that running a mint and a Lightning back-end requires ongoing monitoring and checkups:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
