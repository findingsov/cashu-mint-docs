# Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance

Understand that running a mint and a Lightning back-end requires ongoing monitoring and checkups:

*  Upgrading your mint for latest features and fixes
*  Monitoring access to your system
*  Monitoring the size of your database
*  Watching the balances to make sure no funds are being compromised.
*  Monitor your system (just like any other server you manage)
*  Notifying users if you know you will have an offline situation due to VPS service or other reason.
