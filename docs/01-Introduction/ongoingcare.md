# Ongoing Care

Understand that running a mint and a lightning back-end requires ongoing monitoring and checkups:

*  Monitoring access to your system
*  Monitoring the size of your database
*  Watching the balances to make sure no funds are being compromised.
*  Monitor your system (just like any other server you manage)
*  Notifying users if you know you will have an offline situation due to VPS service or other reason.
