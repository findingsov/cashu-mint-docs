# Getting Started

This guide is currently a generic best practice document that applies across most of the existing mint implementations. 

Note: This site does not cover all mint setup across all mints.

## Knowledge Requirements

To run a mint safely and seccurely, and protect your mint's users, you should have knowledge of the following:

* Networking
* Security
* Care and Feeding of Your Lightning Node

## Hardware Requirements

Mints are pretty lightweight in their system requirements.  However, Docker and Keycloak can consume resources, and should ideally be run on a separate machine.


# Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance

Understand that running a mint and a Lightning back-end requires ongoing monitoring and checkups:

*  Upgrading your mint for latest features and fixes
*  Monitoring access to your system
*  Monitoring the size of your database
*  Watching the balances to make sure no funds are being compromised.
*  Monitoring your system (just like any other server you manage)
*  Notifying users if you know you will have an offline situation due to VPS service or other reason.
*  Keeping all backup keys/seeds/databases in a secure place.
